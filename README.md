# Mouse Move Script

## Overview

This PowerShell script monitors mouse activity and prevents the computer from idling during work hours by simulating small mouse movements.

## Features

- Monitors mouse movement and idle time.
- Automatically moves the mouse cursor slightly to prevent system idle.
- Works within specified work hours (8:00 to 18:00 by default).
- Verbose mode available for detailed logging.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 3.0 or later.
- Windows operating system.

## Usage

1. **Parameters:**
   - `-Verbose (-v)`: Enable verbose mode to display detailed logs.

2. **Execution:**
   - Double-click the script file (`script.ps1`) to execute.
   - PowerShell window will minimize automatically upon execution.

3. **Behavior:**
   - During work hours (8:00 to 18:00), the script monitors mouse activity.
   - If mouse is idle for more than 5 seconds, it simulates a small movement to prevent system idle.
   - Outside work hours, no actions are taken.

## Customization

- **Work Hours:** Modify the `$workStartTime` and `$workEndTime` variables to adjust the work hours.
- **Idle Threshold:** Adjust the `$idleThreshold` variable to change the idle time threshold (in seconds) before mouse movement is triggered.
- **Movement Offset:** Change the `$moveOffsetX` and `$moveOffsetY` variables to set the amount of movement when preventing idle.

## Notes

- Ensure PowerShell script execution policy allows script execution (`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`).
- The script uses Windows API functions for mouse control (`user32.dll`).
