# Mouse Move Script

## Overview

This PowerShell script monitors mouse activity and prevents the computer from idling during work hours by simulating small mouse movements.

## Features

- Monitors mouse movement and idle time.
- Automatically moves the mouse cursor slightly to prevent system idle.
- Works within specified work hours (8:00 to 18:00 by default).
- Verbose mode available for detailed logging.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 3.0 or later.
- Windows operating system.

## Usage

1. **Parameters:**
   - `-Verbose (-v)`: Enable verbose mode to display detailed logs.

2. **Execution:**
   - Double-click the script file (`script.ps1`) to execute.
   - PowerShell window will minimize automatically upon execution.

3. **Behavior:**
   - During work hours (8:00 to 18:00), the script monitors mouse activity.
   - If mouse is idle for more than 5 seconds, it simulates a small movement to prevent system idle.
   - Outside work hours, no actions are taken.

## Customization

- **Work Hours:** Modify the `$workStartTime` and `$workEndTime` variables to adjust the work hours.
- **Idle Threshold:** Adjust the `$idleThreshold` variable to change the idle time threshold (in seconds) before mouse movement is triggered.
- **Movement Offset:** Change the `$moveOffsetX` and `$moveOffsetY` variables to set the amount of movement when preventing idle.

## Notes

- Ensure PowerShell script execution policy allows script execution (`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`).
- The script uses Windows API functions for mouse control (`user32.dll`).

## Conversion to Executable

To convert this PowerShell script into an executable (EXE) format, you can use tools like [PS2EXE](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE). PS2EXE allows you to package your script into a standalone executable that can be run on Windows systems without requiring PowerShell to be installed.

1. **Download PS2EXE:**
   - Visit the [PS2EXE GitHub repository](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE) and download the latest release.

2. **Convert PowerShell Script to EXE:**
   - Follow the instructions provided in the PS2EXE repository to convert your PowerShell script (`main.ps1`) into an EXE file.

3. **Usage:**
   - After conversion, you can distribute the EXE file to users who can execute it directly without needing PowerShell installed on their machines.

Make sure to review the documentation and options provided by PS2EXE to tailor the executable creation process according to your needs.
